Welcome to my website! ðŸŒ„

Once upon a time, I was a software engineer from Silicon Valley.  I worked for large technology companies as well as early-stage startups.  I was primarily a Full Stack Developer, and got some exposure to Firmware and Embedded Software as well.

I digress.  These days I live in the Himalayas of Northern India, and spend my free time exploring the mountains, skiing, and working on my side projects.  Most of my hobbies involve building things; notably 3D Printers, Drones, and E-Bikes.  I also have four dogs and two cats, which is pretty cool!

If by chance you're interested in my professional background, you can find a copy of my resumÃ© <a href="/resume.html">here</a>. 

Life's a mystery... don't forget to have fun! ðŸª‚
